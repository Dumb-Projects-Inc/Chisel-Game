# Chisel Game

A pseudo 3d game written in Chisel, to be run on FPGAs.

## Running

Tested on Basys-3 board.

- Create viviado project, add Clocking Wizard with output clock of 50mhz to the project.
  - It should be enough just to add it to the project! All the necessary blackboxed and topmodules should already be included.
- Add files generated by chisel to project
- Add constraint file to project
- Generate bitsteam and program device! Ensure that basys-3 is connected to vga screen.

## Testing

Verilator is required for testing! Ensure compatible version is installed. Using Nix and the provided flake ensures compatible versions of everything are installed.
